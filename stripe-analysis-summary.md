3. **Secure Error Messages** - No sensitive information disclosed
4. **Standardized Responses** - Consistent error format across all endpoints

## 👤 User Experience Improvements

### 😞 **Before: Poor UX**
- Generic "unexpected error occurred" messages
- No clear guidance for users
- Technical errors exposed
- Inconsistent response formats

### 😊 **After: Excellent UX**
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Specific guidance for error recovery
- User-friendly language throughout
- Consistent, professional responses

## 🎯 Perfect Balance Examples

### **Authentication Error**
```json
// Before (Poor)
{ "error": "An unexpected error occurred" }

// After (Perfect Balance)
{
  "error": "Authentication required. Please log in to continue.",
  "code": "AUTH_REQUIRED",
  "action": "login",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-15T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### **Validation Error**
```json
// Before (Poor)
{ "error": "Invalid input" }

// After (Perfect Balance)
{
  "error": "Minimum payment amount is $0.50. Please increase the amount.",
  "code": "AMOUNT_TOO_LOW",
  "action": "increase_amount",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-15T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### **Rate Limiting**
```json
// Before (Missing)
No rate limiting implemented

// After (Perfect Balance)
{
  "error": "Too many payment requests. Please wait a moment and try again.",
  "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
  "action": "wait_and_retry",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-15T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```
