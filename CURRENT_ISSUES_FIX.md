```
Expected: 30+ items (tents, bikes, kayaks, climbing gear, etc.)
Actual: Only "Insurance" visible
```

### 2. JavaScript Errors
```

/api/payments/create-intent: Failed to load resource: 401
Error creating payment intent: Error: Authentication required. Please log in and try again.
```

## 🎯 Root Cause Analysis

### Main Issue: Environment Variables Missing
The deployed version lacks Firebase and Stripe configuration, causing:
- Authentication failures (401 errors)
- Payment system not working
- Potential JavaScript loading issues

### Secondary Issue: Browser Cache
The "Insurance only" issue is likely:
- **Browser cache** holding old version
- **JavaScript errors** preventing full catalog load

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE FIX STEPS

### Step 1: Re-authenticate with Google Cloud
```bash
gcloud auth login
```

### Step 2: Deploy the Fixed Version
```bash
gcloud run deploy geargrab \
  --source . \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --port=3000 \
  --memory=2Gi \
  --cpu=2 \
  --timeout=300 \
  --concurrency=100 \
  --min-instances=0 \
  --max-instances=10
```

### Step 3: Clear Browser Cache COMPLETELY
After deployment:
1. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Clear all cache**: Browser settings → Clear browsing data → All time
3. **Test in incognito/private mode**
4. **Try different browser** to confirm

## 🔍 Testing the Fix

### Immediate Tests:
1. **Visit**: https://geargrab.co
2. **Check console**: F12 → Console tab (should be no errors)
3. **Count products**: Should see 30+ items, not just Insurance
4. **Test auth**: Try to sign up/login
5. **Test payments**: Try to rent something (should work for authenticated users)

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Full product catalog visible
- ✅ No 404 errors in console
- ✅ Authentication working
- ✅ Payment endpoints responding correctly

## 🚨 If Issues Persist

### For "Insurance Only" Issue:
1. **Test API directly**: Visit `https://geargrab.co/api/listings` in browser
2. **Check response**: Should return JSON with 30+ products
3. **If API returns full data but UI shows only Insurance**:
   - Clear browser cache more aggressively
   - Try different browser
   - Check for JavaScript errors in console

### For Authentication/Payment Issues:
1. **Check environment variables**: Look for Firebase config in page source
2. **Test auth endpoint**: Visit `https://geargrab.co/api/auth/session`
3. **Should return**: 401 (which is correct for unauthenticated users)

## 📋 Success Checklist

After deployment and cache clearing:
- [ ] Homepage shows 30+ products (not just Insurance)
- [ ] No 404 errors in browser console
- [ ] Authentication endpoints working (401 for unauthenticated is correct)
- [ ] Payment endpoints responding (401 for unauthenticated is correct)
- [ ] Images loading properly
- [ ] JavaScript errors resolved
