## Responsive Design Strategy

### Mobile-First Principles
1. **Design for smallest viewport first**: Start with 320px width and scale up
2. **Progressive enhancement**: Add features as screen size increases
3. **Touch-friendly interfaces**: Large tap targets (min 44px√ó44px)
4. **Performance optimization**: Fast initial load times, lazy loading
5. **Simplified navigation**: Hamburger menus, bottom navigation bars
6. **Reduced content density**: Focus on essential information first

### Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: 320px - 639px
- **Tablet**: 640px - 1023px
- **Desktop**: 1024px+

### Components Approach
- Design system with responsive components
- Component states: default, hover, active, disabled
- Device-specific component variations

## Performance Optimization

### Core Web Vitals Focus
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: < 2.5 seconds
