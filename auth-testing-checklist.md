# Authentication & JWT Implementation Testing Checklist

## Overview
This checklist helps verify that the authentication and JWT implementation works correctly across all protected routes in the GearGrab application.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Development server is running (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Firebase configuration is properly set up
- [ ] Environment variables are configured

## Automated Testing

### 1. Run Automated Test Script
```bash
# Run the automated authentication tests
node test-auth-simple.js

# Or with custom URL
TEST_URL=https://your-domain.com node test-auth-simple.js
```

Expected Results:
- [ ] All tests pass with 100% success rate
- [ ] Protected endpoints return 401/403 for unauthenticated requests
- [ ] Invalid JWT tokens are properly rejected
- [ ] Server hooks authentication middleware is working

## Manual Testing

### 2. Unauthenticated Access Tests

#### Protected Pages (Should redirect to login)
- [ ] `/dashboard` → redirects to `/auth/login`
- [ ] `/dashboard/profile` → redirects to `/auth/login`
- [ ] `/dashboard/verification` → redirects to `/auth/login`
- [ ] `/admin` → redirects to `/auth/login`
- [ ] `/admin/security` → redirects to `/auth/login`

#### Protected API Endpoints (Should return 401)
Test these URLs directly in browser or with curl:
- [ ] `/api/bookings` → 401 Unauthorized
- [ ] `/api/conversations` → 401 Unauthorized
- [ ] `/api/admin/security/dashboard` → 401 Unauthorized

```bash
# Test with curl
curl -i http://localhost:5173/api/bookings
curl -i http://localhost:5173/api/conversations
```

### 3. Authentication Flow Tests

#### Login Process
- [ ] Navigate to `/auth/login`
- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] Email/password form is present
- [ ] Google sign-in button is present
- [ ] Form validation works (empty fields, invalid email)

#### Sign Up Process
- [ ] Navigate to `/auth/signup`
- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] Registration form works
- [ ] Password strength validation works
- [ ] Email verification process works

#### Logout Process
- [ ] User can successfully log out
- [ ] Session is properly cleared
- [ ] Redirected to appropriate page after logout

### 4. Authenticated Access Tests

#### After Successful Login
- [ ] User is redirected to intended page (or dashboard)
- [ ] Auth store is properly updated with user data
- [ ] JWT token is stored in localStorage
- [ ] Protected pages are now accessible

#### Protected Pages (Should load successfully)
- [ ] `/dashboard` → loads dashboard content
- [ ] `/dashboard/profile` → loads profile page
- [ ] `/dashboard/verification` → loads verification page
- [ ] Admin pages (if user is admin)

#### Protected API Endpoints (Should work with auth)
Test these with valid authentication:
- [ ] `/api/auth/test` → returns user authentication status
- [ ] `/api/bookings` → returns user's bookings (or empty array)
- [ ] `/api/conversations` → returns user's conversations

### 5. JWT Token Validation Tests

#### Valid Token Tests
- [ ] API calls with valid JWT token succeed
- [ ] Token is automatically included in API requests
- [ ] Server properly validates token signature
- [ ] User data is correctly extracted from token

#### Invalid Token Tests
- [ ] API calls with expired token return 401
- [ ] API calls with malformed token return 401
- [ ] API calls with no token return 401
- [ ] Token refresh works when needed

#### Token Storage Tests
- [ ] Token is stored securely in localStorage
- [ ] Token is cleared on logout
- [ ] Token persists across browser sessions
- [ ] Token is included in Authorization header

### 6. Security Middleware Tests

#### CSRF Protection
- [ ] POST requests without CSRF token are rejected
- [ ] Valid CSRF tokens are accepted
- [ ] CSRF tokens are properly generated

#### Rate Limiting
- [ ] Multiple rapid requests trigger rate limiting
- [ ] Rate limiting returns 429 status code
- [ ] Rate limiting resets after time period

#### Input Validation
- [ ] Invalid input data is rejected
- [ ] SQL injection attempts are blocked
- [ ] XSS attempts are sanitized

### 7. Admin Access Tests (If Applicable)

#### Admin Authentication
- [ ] Regular users cannot access admin routes
- [ ] Admin users can access admin routes
- [ ] Admin status is properly validated server-side

#### Admin API Endpoints
- [ ] `/api/admin/users` → requires admin privileges
- [ ] `/api/admin/security/dashboard` → requires admin privileges
- [ ] Non-admin users get 403 Forbidden

### 8. Session Management Tests

#### Session Creation
- [ ] Sessions are created on successful login
- [ ] Session cookies are set with proper security flags
- [ ] Session data is stored server-side

#### Session Validation
- [ ] Valid sessions allow access to protected resources
- [ ] Invalid sessions are rejected
- [ ] Expired sessions are cleaned up

#### Session Termination
- [ ] Sessions are terminated on logout
- [ ] Session cookies are cleared
- [ ] Server-side session data is removed

## Browser Testing

### 9. Cross-Browser Compatibility
Test authentication in different browsers:
- [ ] Chrome/Chromium
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari (if on macOS)
- [ ] Edge

### 10. Mobile Testing
- [ ] Authentication works on mobile browsers
- [ ] Touch interactions work properly
- [ ] Responsive design maintains functionality

## Error Handling Tests

### 11. Network Error Scenarios
- [ ] Authentication works with slow network
- [ ] Proper error messages for network failures
- [ ] Retry mechanisms work correctly

### 12. Server Error Scenarios
- [ ] Graceful handling of 500 errors
- [ ] Proper error messages for users
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms work

## Performance Tests

### 13. Authentication Performance
- [ ] Login process completes within reasonable time
- [ ] JWT validation doesn't cause significant delays
- [ ] Protected routes load quickly after authentication

## Security Tests

### 14. Security Headers
Check that proper security headers are set:
- [ ] `X-Frame-Options`
- [ ] `X-Content-Type-Options`
- [ ] `X-XSS-Protection`
- [ ] `Strict-Transport-Security` (for HTTPS)

### 15. Cookie Security
- [ ] Session cookies have `HttpOnly` flag
- [ ] Session cookies have `Secure` flag (for HTTPS)
- [ ] Session cookies have `SameSite` attribute

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Protected routes not redirecting to login**
   - Check `auth-guard.svelte` implementation
   - Verify auth store is properly initialized
   - Check route-level authentication logic

2. **API endpoints returning 401 even with valid token**
   - Verify JWT token is being sent in Authorization header
   - Check server-side token validation logic
   - Ensure Firebase Admin SDK is properly configured

3. **Authentication state not persisting**
   - Check localStorage token storage
   - Verify auth store initialization in `+layout.svelte`
   - Check Firebase auth state listener

4. **CSRF protection blocking legitimate requests**
   - Ensure CSRF tokens are properly generated and included
   - Check CSRF validation logic in middleware
   - Verify request headers and content-type

## Test Results Documentation

### Record Test Results
- [ ] All automated tests pass
- [ ] All manual tests completed successfully
- [ ] Any issues identified and documented
- [ ] Performance metrics recorded
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities addressed

### Generate Test Report
```bash
# The automated test script generates a report
cat auth-test-results.json
```

## Next Steps

After completing all tests:
- [ ] Document any issues found
- [ ] Create tickets for any bugs discovered
- [ ] Update authentication documentation
- [ ] Schedule regular security audits
- [ ] Plan for additional security enhancements

## Notes
- Test in both development and production environments
- Use different user accounts for testing
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Keep test credentials secure and separate from production
